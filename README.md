# SpamTextPredictor
The goal of this project is to use scikit-learn's Logistic Regression algorithm to predict whether SMS messages ("texts") are solicited ("ham") or unsolicited ("spam"). This is an application of code introduced in Chapter 8 of Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili, and has been applied to a compilation of "texts" supplied by Tiago Agostinho de Almeida (http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago) and José María Gómez Hidalgo (http://www.esp.uem.es/jmgomez).

Update: Added a script that utilizes multinomial naive Bayes.

Both models yielded ~99% accuracy when optimized.
